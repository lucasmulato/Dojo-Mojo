# Welcome to Dojo-Mojo ðŸ”¥

Hello there! Dojo-Mojo is a documentation of my journey exploring the fascinating world of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and some math, using the Mojo language. (This repo is my dojo in the fight against AI revolution!!!)

## Mathematics in Machine Learning

Machine learning is deeply rooted in mathematics. Understanding the underlying math principles can provide valuable insights into how algorithms work and why they work that way. Here are some of the key mathematical concepts used in machine learning:

1. **Linear Algebra**: It's the branch of mathematics concerning vector spaces and linear relationships between such spaces. It's a foundational building block for machine learning.

2. **Calculus**: It provides a framework for understanding changes in numerical values. In machine learning, we use calculus to optimize our models and to understand the changes in different parameters as our model learns.

3. **Probability and Statistics**: These are key to understanding data and making predictions about future events based on historical data.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It's a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, we have a dataset consisting of both features and labels. The goal is to construct an estimator that is able to predict the label of an object given the set of features.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a dataset with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision.

## Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data. Deep learning drives many artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention.

## Mojo Language

Mojo is an excellent language for machine learning and deep learning. It provides robustness, efficiency, and flexibility in building, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models.

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey!
